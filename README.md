# Air Quality Index Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing Air Quality Index (AQI) data using various data analysis and visualization libraries.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing using Pandas.
- Data visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- Visualization includes line plots, 3D scatter plots, and heatmap of correlations.

## Usage

The script performs the following tasks:
- Reads AQI data from an Excel file.
- Analyzes missing data.
- Creates a line plot of AQI values for different locations.
- Generates 3D scatter plots to explore relationships between AQI, temperature, humidity, and particulate matter levels.
- Creates a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different variables.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

### Steps

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
3. Install the required libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
    ```

### Running the Script

1. Ensure the AQI data file is in the same directory as the script or modify the script to point to the correct file path.
2. Run the script using Python:
    ```bash
    python aqi_data_analysis.py
    ```

## Data File Format

The script expects an Excel file with specific columns: Locations, Status, AQI-US, PM2.5, PM10, Temperature, and Humidity. Ensure your data file matches this format.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the script or extend its functionality are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit pull requests with your changes.
